    <h1>Journey To Full Stack: Progress Notes</h1>
    <h2>This was originally a python file, but that really didn't make sense. Instead, I am using HTML so that I can practice the things I want to learn. Document as much as I can, no matter how small.</h2>

    <p>I watched the following YouTube video for a list of front-end and back-end things to know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgVXmtMUjbI&t=191s">codedamn_url</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHNm7VzYvuY">programming_guru_url</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRxfnHtCxEo">tech_projects_url</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I read the following blog because I encountered an issue with GIT when I tried to push my project to GitHub:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://vcloud-lab.com/entries/blog/solved-visual-studio-code-make-sure-you-configure-your-user-name-and-user-email-in-git">git_issue_url</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>I watched this video on YouTube because it provided a clear roadmap for front-end and back-end. A lot of good keywords:</p>

    <h3>Front End</h3>
    <p>I searched for information about front end. I took notes about the following video(s) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG5ikvJ2TKA" target="_blank">Front-End Development on YouTube</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is used to display content on a webpage and is primarily used in front-end development.</li>
        <li>CSS is used to style web pages and make them visually appealing.</li>
        <li>JavaScript makes web pages interactive and dynamic.</li>
        <li>DOM (Document Object Model) is a feature that allows JavaScript to manipulate the webpage's structure.</li>
        <li>JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are often used to simplify front-end development.</li>
        <li>Tools like Webpack are used to bundle JavaScript code, making it more efficient for deployment.</li>
        <li>TypeScript is a popular transpiler used with JavaScript for adding static typing.</li>
        <li>CSS uses a preprocessor like Sass, which allows you to split CSS into different files for better organization.</li>
        <li>Frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-designed CSS components to streamline front-end development.</li>
        <li>For sending data from the front end to the backend, JavaScript uses methods like XMLHttpRequest, Axios, and the Fetch API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Profiling</h3>
    <p>I took notes about the following video(s): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbBILjDgXb4" target="_blank">Optimizing Rendering Performance in React</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>He mentioned react devtools and things rerender for no reason</li>
        <li>he referenced a react website that had documentation. how does react rerender its children and how does it decide to do so?</li>
        <li>he mentioned react dev tools being installed</li>
        <li>he showed to js file communicating with each other</li>
        <li>his code showed that he created functions. I wish I explained that better, but just making note that I noticed it.</li>
        <li>profiling in progress. he pressed a red dot to record. he looked at why it rendered</li>
        <li>he used a callback. I am not sure of the significance of this yet</li>
       

    <h3>What is WASM?</h3>
    <p>I took notes about the following video(s): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbB3QEwWMlA" target="_blank">Web Assembly WASM</a></p>

    <h3>No full stack activity</h3>
    <p>I spent some time editing 3d models in blender. I also applied to some computer technician roles. I have experiene doing that and I saw a position in my area so I applied.</p>

    <h2>10/19/23</h2>
    <h3>notes</h3>
    <p>I enabled the cloud settings in vs code so that I can access my files from two different computers.</p>
    <p>This video explained how to link a CSS file to an HTMP file: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3rEN55uc4M" target="_blank">Link CSS file to HTML file</a></p>
    <p>This video explained how put my html file on the internet. in other words, it explained how to make it visisble for everyone else. I learned about Github pages: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QU3kLFPdg&t=470s" target="_blank">How to put an HTML website online (on the Internet)</a></p>

    <h2>10/20/23</h2>
    <p>I wanted to add a little clarification here. I struggled to figure out how to use desktop vs code on both devices. Instead, I am using vs code web on the desktop, and </p>the desktop version on the laptop

  
    <h3>  Today I learned about the following:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Typescript</li>
