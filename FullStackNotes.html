    <h1>Journey To Full Stack: Progress Notes</h1>
    <h2>This was originally a python file, but that really didn't make sense. Instead, I am using HTML so that I can practice the things I want to learn. Document as much as I can, no matter how small.</h2>

    <h3>Front End</h3>
    <p>I searched for information about front end. I took notes about the following video(s) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG5ikvJ2TKA" target="_blank">Front-End Development on YouTube</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML is used to display content on a webpage and is primarily used in front-end development.</li>
        <li>CSS is used to style web pages and make them visually appealing.</li>
        <li>JavaScript makes web pages interactive and dynamic.</li>
        <li>DOM (Document Object Model) is a feature that allows JavaScript to manipulate the webpage's structure.</li>
        <li>JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js are often used to simplify front-end development.</li>
        <li>Tools like Webpack are used to bundle JavaScript code, making it more efficient for deployment.</li>
        <li>TypeScript is a popular transpiler used with JavaScript for adding static typing.</li>
        <li>CSS uses a preprocessor like Sass, which allows you to split CSS into different files for better organization.</li>
        <li>Frameworks like Bootstrap provide pre-designed CSS components to streamline front-end development.</li>
        <li>For sending data from the front end to the backend, JavaScript uses methods like XMLHttpRequest, Axios, and the Fetch API.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Profiling</h3>
    <p>I took notes about the following video(s): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbBILjDgXb4" target="_blank">Optimizing Rendering Performance in React</a></p>
    <ul>
        <li>He mentioned react devtools and things rerender for no reason</li>
        <li>he referenced a react website that had documentation. how does react rerender its children and how does it decide to do so?</li>
        <li>he mentioned react dev tools being installed</li>
        <li>he showed to js file communicating with each other</li>
        <li>his code showed that he created functions. I wish I explained that better, but just making note that I noticed it.</li>
        <li>profiling in progress. he pressed a red dot to record. he looked at why it rendered</li>
        <li>he used a callback. I am not sure of the significance of this yet</li>
       

        <h3>What is WASM?</h3>
        <p>I took notes about the following video(s): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbB3QEwWMlA" target="_blank">Web Assembly WASM</a></p>
        <ul>
            <li>write applicaitons for the web in languages other than javascript</li>
            <li>no installation and near native performance</li>
            <li>c++ uses emscripten and turns it into web assembly</li>
            <li>w3C standard approval as of 2019</li>
            <li>assembly script compiles to web assembly. use node js an npm</li>
            <li>compile it down to binary</li>
         
    </ul>
